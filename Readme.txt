This README file provides instructions on how to run our codes, as well as a brief description of each script's functionality.

1. System Requirements
- MATLAB version R2019b or later 
- Operating Systems: Windows 10 or 11
- Any required non-standard hardware: None

2. Installation Guide
- Download the zip file containing the MATLAB scripts and input data files.
- Extract the contents to a directory on your computer.
- Ensure that the directory path is added to the MATLAB path for easy access.

3. Demo
- Instructions to run on data:
  1. Open MATLAB and navigate to the directory containing the extracted files.
  2. Run the following scripts to perform the respective analyses:
     - Run ‘Script_GLM_MDneu41.m’ for Generalized Linear Model analysis.
     - Run ‘Script_Behavior_LearningCurve.m’ for behavior performance analysis.
     - Run ‘Script_DI_OFCexample.m’ for DI analysis. 
  3. Each script will load the corresponding input data file (e.g., ‘Data_DI_OFCexample.mat’ ) and generate plots based on the analysis.

- Expected output:
  - Each script will produce a figure window displaying the results of the analysis.

- Expected run time for demo on a "normal" desktop computer:
  - GLM analysis: Approximately 1 minutes

4. Instructions for use
- How to run the software on your data:
  1. Prepare your data in the same format as the provided input data files 
  2. Modify the script files to load your data file instead of the provided 
  3. Run the scripts as described in the demo instructions.

- (OPTIONAL) Reproducibility instructions:
  - To ensure reproducibility, please use the same MATLAB version and operating system as specified in the system requirements.
  - Ensure that all dependencies and toolboxes used by the scripts are installed.
